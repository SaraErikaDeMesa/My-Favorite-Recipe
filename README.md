Welcome to my website about my favorite foods! This website is a simple HTML and CSS project that showcases my love for all things delicious.

On the Homepage, you'll find a navigation menu that will allow you to explore the different type of foods that I enjoy.

Each menu is linked to another page that shows the ingredients and recipe for each dish.

I hope you enjoy exploring my website and learning about my favorite foods!
