                <li>1 cup of frozen peas and carrots</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>

            <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <ol> <!--ordered List of the Ingredients -->
                <li> Prepare your rice according to package directions. Set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <li> In a large skillet or wok, heat vegetable oil over medium heat and add onion and garlic. Cook until onions are soft, about 2 to 3 minutes. Make sure to stir occasionally to keep the garlic from burning. Add peas and carrots and cook until partially thawed, 1 to 2 minutes. Youâ€™ll need to adjust this time if you use fresh veggies.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Turn the heat up to medium-high and add cooked rice. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until rice is nice and hot and starts to brown.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Reduce heat and push the rice to the sides of the pan, making a hole in the center of the pan for the eggs. Crack eggs into the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Scramble the eggs in the middle of the pan. Once eggs are cooked, stir the cooked egg into the rice.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Mix soy sauce and sesame oil together and pour over rice. Stir until rice is evenly coated with sauce.</li>
                <br>
                <li> To serve this fried rice, top with chopped green onions. You could even use cilantro and toasted sesame seeds as additional toppings.</li>
            </ol>
